# AEMR-SQL-Data-Analysis
The American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) is responsible for looking after the United States' domestic energy network. The regulator's responsbility is to ensure the energy network remains reliable with minimal disruptions (outages).  
There are four key types of outages:  
-Consequential  
-Forced  
-Opportunistic  
-Planned  
There were a large number of energy providers that submitted outages over 2016-2017, and to address these, analysis will be broken down into the following two areas:  
A. Energy Stability and Market Outages  
B. Energy Losses and Market Reliability
