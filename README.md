# AEMR-SQL-Data-Analysis
The American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) is responsible for ensuring the United States' domestic energy network remains reliable with minimal disruptions (outages).  
There are four key types of outages:  
-Consequential  
-Forced  
-Opportunistic  
-Planned  
There were a large number of energy providers that submitted outages over 2016-2017, and to address these, analysis will be broken down into the following two areas:  

A. Energy Stability and Market Outages  
Questions such as:  
-What are the most common outage types?  
-Were any outage types increasing in frequency?
-Were there any energy providers that were less reliable (i.e. had outages with more frequency, of longer duration than their peers)?  

B. Energy Losses and Market Reliability  
Forced outages are of particular concern. As they are unplanned, they present an energy security risk. They occur when an energy provider intends to provide energy but are unable able to do so because they are forced offline. This section of the analysis focuses on forced outages.  
Questions such as:  
-What percent of outages were forced?
-What was the average duration and energy lost of forced outages for each provider?
-Which were the top three participants by energy lost due to forced outages?
